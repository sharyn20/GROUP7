<center><h3>In the tapestry of life, woven threads of gold <br>
Through the highs and lows, our stories unfold. <br>
Side by side, through thick and thin, <br>
With you, my friend, the journey begins. <br>
Hand in hand, we'll walk this road, <br>
Together, through the highs and the lows. <br>
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand strong, <br>
Forever bound by the ties of our song. <br>
<br>
In the darkest night, you're my guiding light, <br>
With your warmth beside me, everything's alright. <br>
Through storms we weather, and battles we fight, <br>
Our friendship's flame burns ever bright. <br>
Hand in hand, we'll walk this road, <br>
Together, through the highs and the lows. <br>
